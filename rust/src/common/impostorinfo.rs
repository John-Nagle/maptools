//! Upload Second Life / Open Simulator terrain to server
//! Part of the Animats impostor system
//!
//! A Second Life/Open Simulator LSL script records terrain heights when visiting
//! regions. It calls this FCGI responder to upload that data to a server.
//! Later processing turns that into objects viewable in world via the
//! region impostor system.

//!     August, 2025.
//!
//! Once impostors have been created and uploaded to SL/OS, an LSL script tells this
//! server about them. Messages are JSON, and look roughly like this:
//!
//! {"comment":"Generated from sculpt texture UUIDS fetched from inventory","version":"1.0","name":"Blake Sea - Kraken",
//!  "region_loc":[290304,268288],"region_size":[256,256],"grid":"agni","elevation_offset":0.000000,
//!    "scale":[256,256,25.690001],"water_height":20.000000,"sculpt_uuid":"64604b5c-461e-dd72-52a9-3d464abf78aa","impostor_lod":0},
//! 
//! This is very close to the JSON sent to the viewer.
